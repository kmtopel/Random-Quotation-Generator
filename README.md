# Random-Quotation-Generator
This web application is a random quotation generator, which I built using JavaScript (jQuery), CSS, and HTML. 
This project was a practice in working with data from an API and a way for me to familiarize myself with Front-End Development.

The functionality is straightforward -- the "Next" button will load a new quotation, while the Twiter icon will share the current quotation to one's twitter feed.
